# Project--A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners

This project is an analysis of the Nobel Prize, one of the most well-known scientific awards in the world, and its recipients from 1901 to 2016. The project begins by loading the Nobel Prize dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and examining the first several winners.

The analysis then goes on to investigate the gender and nationality of the winners. It is revealed that men have dominated the prize since its inception, and the United States has the most winners overall. The project also explores when the USA began to dominate the Nobel charts, showing that it was in the 1930s.

The next step in the analysis is to investigate whether the gender imbalance varies across the six different categories of the Nobel Prize. It is found that physics, economics, and chemistry have the largest gender imbalance, while medicine has a more positive trend, and literature is now more balanced. The analysis concludes by identifying the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize.

The project also explores the age at which Nobel laureates receive their prizes and investigates the age differences between prize categories. It is found that the age of winners has increased over time, with the average age being around 55 in the early 1900s and now closer to 65. The density of points is also much higher nowadays than in the early 1900s, as there are more shared prizes. The peace prize shows an opposite trend, where winners are getting younger.

Finally, the project identifies the oldest and youngest people ever to have won a Nobel Prize, and the name of the youngest winner in 2014. The project is a comprehensive analysis of the Nobel Prize, covering a range of topics and providing insight into the history of the prize and its winners.
